Component Building HOW-TO:
--------------------------
This file contains the instructions to build the source code provided with the zip package funambol-j2me-mail-X.Y.Z.zip, where X.Y.Z is the release version number of the downloaded component.

1. System Requirements:
    - Download and install Apache Ant: http://ant.apache.org/
    - Download and install Sun Java Wireless Toolkit: http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/
    - Download and install Apache Antenna: http://antenna.sourceforge.net/
    - Download and install Blackberry JDE: http://na.blackberry.com/eng/developers/

2. Funambol component required: Funambol Common Library component

3. Pre-Build process configuration:
3.1 Unzip the package into your working directory (<mail-dir>)
3.2 Open the <mail-dir>/build/build.properties file in your editor
3.2 Set the right path for:
    - WTK home on your environment
      wtk.home=<wtk-home>
      Example: wtk.home=C:/wtk2.5.2
    - Junit Test jar library (provided with the wtk lib)
      lib.junit=<wtk-home>/lib/JMUnit4CLDC10.jar
      Example: wtk.home=C:/wtk2.5.2/lib/JMUnit4CLDC10.jar
    - The location Funambol Common Library component
      lib.funambol.common=<common-dir>/output/funambol-j2me-common.jar
      Example: lib.funambol.common=${basedir}/../common/output/funambol-j2me-common.jar
      The value of basedir parameter is ".." so it points to <mail-dir>. See the Common component HOW-TO.txt in order to generate the required jar file
      
4. Building the source:
4.1 Open a command prompt and go to the directory <mail-dir>/build
4.2 Type "ant usage" and press the ENTER key
4.3 The "ant usage" menu will appear. Build your package simply typing "ant" and hitting enter. For any other commands follow the "ant usage" instructions.
4.4 The build process generates the required jar file for the built component into the directory <mail-dir>/output

In case of any problems with the build process, access the Funambol Community Forge Project  following this link: https://core.forge.funambol.org and contact Funambol for support.

/**
 * This class class implements the SyncSource interface, adding a method to
 * detect the changes in the local store since the last sync based on cache
 * files to make easier the implementation of new sync sources. 
 *
 * It requires an instance of a class implementing the KeyValueStore interface
 * to store the sync cache, made by pairs of LUID (the local id of the item) and
 * a fingerprint (default method is CRC of the content, but can be a timestamp
 * or any other way to detect a change on the item). By default, CacheSyncSource 
 * is able to obtain a PropertyFile (which implements KeyValueStore as a file), 
 * but if a more efficient way to store it is available for the platform, the
 * developer can create anoher store and pass it in the CacheSyncSource constructor
 * (see also the SQLKeyValueStore abstract class).
 *
 * The mandatory methods to implement are:
 * <li><b>getAllItemList</b>: returns a list of StringBuffer with all the keys
 *      of the items in the data store</li>
 * <li><b>insertItem</b>: adds a new item into the data store</li>
 * <li><b>modifyItem</b>: modifies an item in the data store</li>
 * <li><b>removeItem</b>: removes an item from the data store</li>
 * <li><b>removeAllItems</b>: removes all the items from the data store</li>
 * <li><b>getItemContent</b>: get the content of an item given the key</li>
 *
 * The optional methods, that can be overloaded to change the behavior of the
 * user sync source, are:
 * <li><b>getItemSignature</b>: get a fingerprint of the item, which is any
 *      string which allows to detech changes in the item</li>
 *

The DevGuide is a DocBook 4.4 document. It can be used to generate documentation
in different formats. A PDF version is included in this same directory.

There are many different tools to manipulate DocBook documents. Beside editing
tools, there are tools that can be used to convert docbook into other formats.
For example the pdf version available in this directory has been generated on
linux with these two commands:

1) xmlto fo DevGuide.docbook
2) JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jre_1.6 fop DevGuide.fo -pdf DevGuide.pdf

The tools used in this case are xmlto and fop. Both are open source. xmlto can
be replaced with many other tools that generate a fop file from a docbook.
Generating the html version is also very easy. On Linux it can be generated with
this simple command:

1) xmlto html DevGuide.docbook

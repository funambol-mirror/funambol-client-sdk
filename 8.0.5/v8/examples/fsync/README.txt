Funambol File Sync example
__________________________

Overview
========
This example shows how to build a simple but working client using the Funabol
SDK. 


Downloading
===========

The source code of the examples are bundled with the Funambol C++ SDK code.
You can obtain them both from a released package from the Funambol website, or
checking out from the Subversion repository.

Please refer to the Funambol C++ SDK for details on how to obtain and compile
it.


Building
========

Build environments are available for the supported platforms. To build
for a certain platform, go to the subdirectory in "build" which matches
your platform and follow the instructions there.

The fsync example currently works on Windows and Unix (including Linux and
MacOS).

For Windows, you'll need VisualStudio 2005. Success have been reported also
using Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition.

For Unix/Linux, under "build/posix" you can find the normal GNU
configure/make. Please report any issue you may have using this on other Unix
variants.

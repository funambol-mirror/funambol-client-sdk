Funambol C++ API
________________

Overview
========
This SDK allows to integrate a syncml stack in a C++ application on a variety
of platforms. Currently, Windows, WinMobile and Linux, MacOs, iPhone and
Symbian are actively supported, but you can easily build it on other Unixes or
other mobile/embedded platforms.

Please report your experiences with these platforms to the Funambol
community, preferably using the users discussion group. It can be used as a web forum at this address:

	http://core.forge.funambol.org/ds/viewForumSummary.do?dsForumId=405

or as a mailing list at this address:

	users@core.forge.funambol.org

You can use the discussion ofrm you like more.

Downloading
===========

You can obtain the sources both from a released package from the Funambol
website, or checking out the latest version from Subversion. In the second way
you'll get a state-of-the-art version, but you may find bugs or even run into
problems building it (even though we try to avoid it). Please report this using
the mailing list or the bug tracker.

To build the latest version for WinMobile, which supports the compression of
the SyncML stream, you need also to get the zlib sources for WinMobile. You can
find it mirrored in the Funambol CVS under 'tools/zlib'. Just check it out
under the client-api tree and the build project will find and compile it. To
make it more clear, the expected tree is:

    client-api/
        tools/
            zlib
        native/
            src
            build
              

You can find more info on zlib for Windows CE at:
http://www.tenik.co.jp/~adachi/wince/zlibce/index.html

If you don't need the ZLIB support, undefine the USE_ZLIB macro in your
build environment.


Building
========

Build environments are available for the supported platforms. To build
for a certain platform, go to the subdirectory in "build" which matches
your platform and follow the instructions there.

For Windows and WinMobile, you'll need VisualStudio 2005. Success have
been reported also using Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition.

For Unix/Linux, under "build/autotools" you can find the normal GNU
configure/make. Please report any issue you may have using this on other
Unix variants.


Patches
=======

The .patches directory contains contributors patches which have not been
imported into CVS yet, usually because the current branch is frozen in
preparation for a release.

They can be applied automatically with Holger Schurig's patcher utility:

  http://www.holgerschurig.de/patcher.html

This simple Perl script can be downloaded from that page, but is also
packaged as part of e.g. Debian 3.1 (Sarge).

To just apply the patches:
- enter the "client-api/native" directory
- enter "patcher -A"

This utility can also be used to create new patches or to update
existing ones: this might be necessary when the regular files in CVS
have been modified since the time when the patch was created or when
some patches have been applied in the meantime.

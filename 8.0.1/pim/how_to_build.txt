Component Building HOW-TO:
--------------------------
This file contains the instructions to build the source code provided with the zip package funambol-j2me-pim-X.Y.Z.zip, where X.Y.Z is the release version number of the downloaded component.

1. System Requirements:
    - Download and install Apache Ant: http://ant.apache.org/
    - Download and install Sun Java Wireless Toolkit: http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/
    - Download and install Apache Antenna: http://antenna.sourceforge.net/
    - Download and install Blackberry JDE: http://na.blackberry.com/eng/developers/ (if building BlackBerry version)
    - Download and install JavaCC 4.0: https://javacc.dev.java.net/ (note that 4.1 does not work with J2ME)

2. Funambol component required:
    - common/pim-parsers (https://core.forge.funambol.org/svn/core/trunk/funambol/common/pim-parsers/)
      Source code is needed as it needs to be recompiled.
    - Funambol Common Library component
    - Funambol SyncML Library component

3. Pre-Build process configuration:
3.1 Unzip the package into your working directory (<pim-dir>)
3.2 Open the <pim-dir>/build/build.properties file in your editor
3.2 Set the right path for:
    - WTK home on your environment
      wtk.home=<wtk-home>
      Example: wtk.home=C:/wtk2.5.2
    - J2MEunit Test jar library (provided with the wtk lib)
      lib.junit=<wtk-home>/lib/j2meunit.jar
      Example: wtk.home=C:/wtk2.5.2/lib/j2meunit.jar
    - The tinyline gzip jar library is a third party compression utility provided with the client and it can be retireved into the zip package under:
      lib.gzip=lib/tinyline-gzip.jar (leave this value unchanged)
    - The Blackeberry JDE home dir is required to build the API for BlackBerry; they are compliant with the API provided by RIM:
      bb.jdehome=<BB jde home dir>
      Example: bb.jdehome=C:/tools/Research In Motion/Blackberry JDE 4.1.0
    - The Javacc home dir 
      Example: javacchome=C:/javacc-4.0

4. Building the source:
4.1 Open a command prompt and go to the directory <pim-dir>/build
4.2 Type "ant usage" and press the ENTER key
4.3 The "ant usage" menu will appear. Build your package simply typing "ant" and hitting enter. For any other commands follow the "ant usage" instructions.
4.4 The build process generates the required jar file for the built component into the directory <pim-dir>/output

In case of any problems with the build process, access the Funambol Community Forge Project  following this link: https://core.forge.funambol.org and contact Funambol for support.

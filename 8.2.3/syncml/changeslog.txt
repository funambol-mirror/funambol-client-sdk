Funambol J2ME SyncML API Changes Log
----------------------------------
2010-04-19
    - Released 8.2.3

2010-04-08
    - Fixed bug #9009 (items could be duplicated after interrupting a fast sync)

2010-02-24
    - Added support for MD5 authentication

2009-10-09
    - Fix for bug #7929 (Cancelling a sync may result in a generic error instead
      of a cancelled error on the BB sync client)

2009-10-06
    - Added a new property to the SourceConfig where it is possible to limit the
      number of items to be sent to the server in a single SyncML message during
      slow syncs.

2009-09-15
    - Improved SyncManager to allow clients to specify their own TransportAgent
      (the engine still defaults to an HttpTransportAgent)

2009-09-08
    - Fixed bug in the SyncManager which did not send SyncHdr status (regression
      introduced when the SyncMLFormatter was split from the manager)

2009-07-16
    - Added support of the SupportHierarchicalSync tag in the SyncMLParser

2009-06-03
    - Added support for server capabilities (US 2276).
    - Added a first implementation of SyncMLParser and SyncMLFormatter

2009-05-26
    - Added method to "cancel" a sync from the SyncManager (step 1, does not
      interrupt network operations)
    - Use absolute file names as LUID in the FileSyncSource

2009-05-22
    - Added custome sync mode: one way from client without slow syncs. This sync
      mode is identical (client side) to one way from client.

2009-05-18
    - Changed the FileSyncSource which is now able to handle both OMA file objects
      and raw files.
    
2009-05-12
    - Added the ability to set the SyncItem parent from the TargetParent tag
      or the SourceParent if not present.

2009-04-28
    - Merged the portable branch.
      - The library can be built on various platforms, including Java ME, SE and
        BB (preliminary support for Android)
      - Large objects handling is completely performed by the Sync Engine.
        Sources are just required to create SyncItems with an Input and Output
        Stream.
      - The new model is not 100% compatible with the old one and it requires
        sources to be adjusted to implement the createSyncItem method.
      - Added some new unit tests
      - Unit tests are now JUnit 3.8 compataible
      - The MappingManager now uses a StringKeyValueStore instead of an
        AbstractRecordStore

2009-03-11
    - Implementation of ConfigSyncSource to allow configuration synchronization

2009-02-11
    - Bug fix: SyncManager was invoking the SyncListener with a bogus status at the end 
      of the sync process 

2009-01-23
    - Merged branch e_marcoct
      - First refactoring step for the SyncManager to allow unit testing
      - Added a concept of TrackableSyncSource, ChangesTracker
      - Added a FileSyncSource implementation based on TrackableSyncSource that
        works one way (from client to server)
      - Added a CacheTracker that tracks changes based on item's fingerprint

2008-11-15
    - WIFI introduced for Blackberry devices
    - Connection framework changed

2007-08-10
Released J2ME client 6.5.0

    - Added SyncListener interface. The SyncManager notifies
      the interface during synchronization, providing complete
      information on what is going on.
    - Extended SyncSource interface to allow retrieving of a synthetic error
      code and retrival of more information about items to be sent to the server
      (client can ask for the number of deleted/updated/added items)

2007-07-2 (6.0.11)
    - Retry on broken connection

2007-06-1 (6.0.10)
    - Simplified exception scheme
    - Default User agent changed

2007-05-11 (6.0.8)
    - Handling of error 503 from server

2007-04-02
    - syncml parser optimized

2007-02-27
    - memory optimization
    - compress http stream
    - mapping sent for each message

2006-10-27
    - First import on CVS.
    - Basic Java ME SyncML implementation
